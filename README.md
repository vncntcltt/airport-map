# airport-map

This Vue project demonstrates how to display clusterable and selectable airports on a Leaflet map.

It uses [Leaflet Marker Cluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) and [Leaflet lasso](https://github.com/zakjan/leaflet-lasso) plugins.

Flight data comes from https://github.com/mwgg/Airports.

See the [demo](https://vncntcltt.github.io/airport-map) in action.
